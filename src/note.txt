typescript are created to address the shortcoming of javascript 

Benefits of typescript
- static typing 
- code completion
- refactoring 
- shorthand notations

drawback of typescript
 - compilation 
 - Discpiline in coding 
 
Setup development environment 
- Node we're using NPM(node package Manager)

to check the version of typescript
 - tsc -v
how to generate the typescript configuration
 - tsc --init (write this in terminal)

 to target the new javascript ecmascript you can delete 
 the one availabe and press Ctrl + space to list all options

- Its better to declare an array types before start using it.
- tupple types can help in case we want represent an array of different types of element 
- tupple are useful when we have only two values like key/value pairs
- using an enum we can create a group of related constants
- If we define out enum using constant keyword the compiler will generate optimized javascript code
- As best practise always anotates your functions, parameters
- always enables this three compiler options 
   * noUsedLocals
   * noUsedParameters
   * noImplicitReturns 
- when can use union to expose more than one type for single element
- Nullish coalescing operator(??) this means that 
   the value can be null or defined otherwise use that value 
   ex: speed: speed ?? 30
